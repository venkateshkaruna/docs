# Create User

## Test Body

This is the current user group token you have for the user group that you want to rotate.

#### Response

Indicates whether the call was successful. 1 if successful, 0 if not.

The contents of the user group

This is the internal ID for this user group. You don't need to record this information, since you will not need to use it. This is the user group token (userGroupToken or USER\_GROUP\_TOKEN) that will be used to identify which user group is viewing the dashboard. You should save this on your end to use when rendering an embedded dashboard. This is the name of the user group provided in the request body. This is the user\_group\_id provided in the request body. This is the environment tag of the user group. Possible values are 'Customer' and 'Testing'. User group id's must be unique to each environment, so you can not create multiple user groups with with same id. If you have a production customer and a test user group with the same id, you will be required to label one as 'Customer' and another as 'Testing'
